      - Migrated old code base with AngularJS to a new stack with React and RTK
      - Refactored old code base and reduced TBT (Total Blocking Time) in 60%.
      - Improved configurability of the product and it allowed to release the new one "Getform" based on the current codebase.

    description: Novakid is an online language school for children.
      Service contains a media server for making video calls between teacher and student in browser and a working space with slides and mini games and whiteboard for lessons.
      During my work there I went from being a single frontend developer to taking over the role of tech lead.
      It was my first time going from idea to implementation and project highload (more than 1000 active video calls between users a day).
      It all became possible thanks to company CEO Maxim Azarov.
    achievements:
      - Researched and integrated our platform with the open source media server "Kurento". It allowed us not to avoid developing our own solution and launch the first version faster.
      - Designed NodeJS application for making video calls between teacher and student in browser via WebRTC technology.
      - Planned and managed all new releases of the platform for about a year when I was a Tech Lead.
